## Optical Flow
According to Wikipedia: 
  Optical flow or optic flow is the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual 
  scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Optical flow can also be defined as 
  the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.
    
Intutively optical flow describes the shift in position of a particular pixel in successive frames . Although pixel positions 
as well as number of pixels in a frame of given size remain constant , it must be kept in mind that when we view successive 
frames the neighbouring pixels will grab its pixel intensity from a particular pixel if the intensity of original pixel changes.

More information on optical flow can be obtained from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow#:~:text=Optical%20flow%20or%20optic%20flow,brightness%20pattern%20in%20an%20image.)


Here is an Optical Flow tracker using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
